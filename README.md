# The Knox Programming Language

Knox is an experiment in learning Go and learning more about compilers. The compiler is written in Go and generates Go.

The principles behind the design of Knox are:
 - Small language. Simple and consistent syntax with few constructs, as an alternative to Go.
 - Explicitness. Explicit and unambiguous code is a priority, even over brevity. No surprises.
 - Data structures. Lists and maps are first-class data structures that should be as easy as Python.
 - Pass by reference. All complex types should be pass by reference and pointers should be hidden.
 - Well-behaved. Error handling and unit testing are first-class constructs.
